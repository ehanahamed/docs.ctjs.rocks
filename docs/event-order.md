# Event order in ct.js

These events are always executed in the following order:

1. Core ct.js library runs;
1. Modules get initialized;
1. Custom scripts added at project settings are executed;
1. room's `oncreate` event is called, which is emitted when a user starts a game or navigates to a new room;
1. `oncreate` is applied for each copy;
1. then the main game loop starts:
    1. `onstep` event is emitted for all the copies in the room;
    1. `onstep` event for current room is called;
    1. `ondestroy` is called for all the copies marked to be `kill`ed;
    1. all the copies are reordered then;
    1. `ondraw` is called for all the copies;
    1. `ondraw` is called for a room;
    1. input events are cleared. Waiting for a new game loop iteration.
1. When a user moves to a new room, an `onleave` event is called for the latest room.
